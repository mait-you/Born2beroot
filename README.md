## What's a virtual machine?
**Virtual Machine (VM)** is a software capable of installing an Operating System (**OS**) within itself, making the OS think that it is hosted on a real computer. With virtual machines we can create virtual devices that will behave in the same way as physical devices, using their own CPU, memory, network interface and storage. This is possible because the virtual machine is hosted on a physical device, which is the one that provides the hardware resources to the VM.

### What’s a Hypervisor?

A **Hypervisor** is software that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs) on a physical device. It enables multiple operating systems to run simultaneously by allocating separate hardware resources to each VM.

- **Hosted Hypervisor**: Runs on top of an existing OS (e.g., Windows or Linux). Typically used for personal computers.
- **Bare-Metal Hypervisor**: Runs directly on the physical hardware without requiring an underlying OS. Common in servers and data centers.
